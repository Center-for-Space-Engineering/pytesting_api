# Using pytest: Fixtures and Parameters

pytest is a powerful testing framework for Python that makes it easy to write simple and scalable tests. In this guide, we'll explore how to use pytest fixtures and parameters to set up test environments and run tests with different inputs.

## Fixtures

Fixtures in pytest are functions that provide setup and teardown logic for tests. They allow you to define reusable setup code that can be shared across multiple test functions. Here's how to use fixtures in pytest:

1. **Defining Fixtures:**
   ```python
   import pytest

   @pytest.fixture
   def setup_data():
       # Setup logic: create test data
       data = [1, 2, 3]
       yield data  # Provide the setup data to the test function
       # Teardown logic: clean up resources (optional)
   ```

2. **Using Fixtures in Tests:**
   ```python
   def test_example(setup_data):
       # Test function that uses the setup_data fixture
       assert len(setup_data) == 3
   ```

3. **Fixture Scope:**
   Fixtures can have different scopes (`function`, `class`, `module`, `session`), which determine when they are set up and torn down. The default scope is `function`, which means the fixture is invoked once per test function.

4. **Fixture Dependencies:**
   Fixtures can depend on other fixtures, allowing you to build a hierarchy of setup logic. When a test function requests a fixture as an argument, pytest automatically resolves and invokes the required fixtures in the correct order.

## Parameters

Parameterization in pytest allows you to run the same test function with different inputs. It's useful for testing multiple scenarios with varying data. Here's how to use parameters in pytest:

1. **Defining Parameters:**
   ```python
   @pytest.mark.parametrize("input, expected", [(1, 2), (2, 4), (3, 6)])
   def test_multiply_by_two(input, expected):
       assert input * 2 == expected
   ```

2. **Using Parameters in Tests:**
   The `@pytest.mark.parametrize` decorator allows you to specify input values and expected outcomes for each test case.

3. **Dynamic Parameters:**
   Parameters can be dynamically generated using fixtures or other logic, allowing for more flexible test scenarios.

## Examples

Here are some examples demonstrating the usage of fixtures and parameters in pytest:

1. **Using Fixtures:**
   ```python
   @pytest.fixture
   def setup_data():
       data = [1, 2, 3]
       yield data
   ```

2. **Using Parameters:**
   ```python
   @pytest.mark.parametrize("input, expected", [(1, 2), (2, 4), (3, 6)])
   def test_multiply_by_two(input, expected):
       assert input * 2 == expected
   ```
